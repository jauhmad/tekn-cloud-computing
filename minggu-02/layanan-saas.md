Overview
1. draw.io
draw.io isn't the best flowchart or diagramming app, but it is the best one that offers a totally free level of service. Draw.io has a paid version for Confluence Server, which is how the app is profitable, but all its other versions, including the online Web-based one reviewed below, are free. This tool helps you create diagrams and other visuals with a lot more ease than if you were using vector software. When used with Google Drive, Draw.io has good support for real-time collaboration so that more than one person can work on a diagram simultaneously. Because many diagramming apps, such as Microsoft Visio, can be expensive, the free Draw.io is a fine option if you only need this kind of software every so often. If diagramming is an important part of your work, however, you should pay for a more powerful app. Lucidchart and SmartDraw are the Editors' Choices in this category.

2. Visio
Microsoft Visio is one of the most popular diagramming software that empowers diagramming, data visualization, and process modelling in a familiar interface. Visio comes with an array of templates and built-in shapes that allow creating virtually any diagram of any complexity. Visio also allows users to define their own shapes and import them into the drawing.

Visio has been more of an enterprise-class software as home users rarely would need to use the advanced diagramming functions in Visio. However, many home users are purchasing the Standard edition of Visio to better visualize simple diagrams such as family trees or floor layout plans.

Visio owes its success in the enterprise due to its tight integration with other Microsoft Office products such as Word, Excel, and Access. Data can be directly imported from these softwares and converted into meaningful diagrams, which change in real-time in accordance with the data. For example, an Excel spreadsheet might have information about current flows through an electrical line. Visio can be used to diagrammatically represent this and whenever the Excel data gets updated, the same will be reflected in the Visio diagram as well.

Newer versions of Visio from Visio 2013 onwards support .vsdx format that allows enhanced compression and many other features compared to the older .vsd format supported by Visio 2010 and earlier versions. Visio can be purchased standalone in two versions â€” a Standard version, which retails for $299, and a Professional version, which retails for $589.99. The latest version of Visio can also be purchased as part of the Office 365 subscription with access to the online Visio viewer as well. Getting Visio as part of Office 365 is the best choice in order to keep up-to-date with the latest features and enhancements.

3. Calligra flow
Calligra Flow is an easy to use diagramming and flowcharting application with tight integration to the other Calligra applications. It enables you to create network diagrams, organisation charts, flowcharts and more.
